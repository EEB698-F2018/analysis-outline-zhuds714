Assignment feedback for Zach Hudson

Oct 1: I'm not seeing your pratice data or R script, or the correct folders. Can you upload these? Thanks!

Dec 3: I think your tidy data is in two places, because of a capitalization error in your code, and that you have data in your general folder.
Work on cleaning up your folder structure to follow the folders recommended for the class. 
Also, I don't see analysis or graphics or data wrangling folders - please create these and populate them with the appropriate files.  
And be sure to put your powerpoint in here too. 
There are two copies of the analysis_outline - can you delete whichever one is not the most recent? 

Data management plan looks good!

Assignment feedback for Zach Hudson

Oct 1: I'm not seeing your pratice data or R script, or the correct folders. Can you upload these? Thanks!

Dec 3: I think your tidy data is in two places, because of a capitalization error in your code, and that you have data in your general folder.
Work on cleaning up your folder structure to follow the folders recommended for the class. 
Also, I don't see analysis or graphics or data wrangling folders - please create these and populate them with the appropriate files.  
And be sure to put your powerpoint in here too. 
There are two copies of the analysis_outline - can you delete whichever one is not the most recent? 

Data management plan looks good! 

Dec 18: Not sure why the GitHub version doesn't look like the version I cloned/downloaded. testing using this note. It changed this file online, showing that they are linked, but I still don't know why the _data folder doesn't show up here, and the _Data folder here has more htan the one online. Confusing. 

Your analysis & results section is quite short, but otherwise the project components are all there. 

You've come a long way this semester, from not using R to coding a lot! I look forward to seeing what you find with your actual data, and I encourage you to talk again with Dean Adams or stats consultants about the analysis and setting up the dataframe - I think a multivariate approach would work for you.
